# Notes.txt

I noticed that, in the Houzz website, the carasoul links to another page. I initally created that, but realized it wasn't part of the directions.

I tried to write my code in a way where the functionality was separated and would be easier for someone else to dig through. 

I used create-react-app to get the project started.
